### Setup Instructions
ToDo -- Add Setup Instructions


### Bots
#### Tutorial Starter Bot
This contains the untouched code from the Tutorial I followed here:
https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html

#### Zora
Zora will become the ClubPython official bot. She will have all sorts of great commands.
Some just for fun, and others to help organize and administer our community.

Right now Zora is just using mostly the same code from the Starter bot, with a few added
basic commands, but we will be adding to this all the time. 

If you'd like to get involved just DM me @kill.will on the Slack Channel and I'll you 
some ideas to get started!


### ToDo
